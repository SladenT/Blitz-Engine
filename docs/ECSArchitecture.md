## Overview

Most objects in the game are composed of a signle Entity structure, which is then logically bound with an ID with a number of components.  The entity in and of itself consists of an ID, a Transform (detailing its scale, rotation and position), and a possible parent entity - of which if there is none, is the value of UINT64_MAX, as defined in stdint.h.

Components are physically disparate from their various couplings, in memory, for various reasons.  First of which being that there are disparate parts of the game loop and pipeline, which require different entities at different times, and process a large number of different entities at once.  By using this modular structure, we should be able to load in only the data we need for processing, thus minimizing cache misses (as the cache will be full of data we need to process).  Second, this allows us to create highly dynamic entities, which follow no set or predetermined path, granting a number of benefits, first of which is the ability to edit any logically constructed entity without messing up some other part of it.  An unfortunate downside to this structure is that, from a pure code view point of view, it is more difficult to keep track of what, exactly, each entity consists of.  Hopefully I will remember to construct some tooling to alleviate this issue.
