This is the capstone project for Shepherd University students Davis Teigeler, Aaron Hartle, and Evan Posharow.  It is an RTS (details pending) created using OpenGL 3.3.

## Build Instructions

1. Install MinGW (this was setup using version 12.2, but the latest should work), to ensure you get the gcc compiler
2. Add the folder to VSCode
3. Create a "bin" subdirectory and move the glfw3.dll and cglm.dll from lib into that folder
4. Run it using the play button
